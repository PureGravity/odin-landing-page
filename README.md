Odin Landing Page

This landing page was created as a project to test my understanding of HTML and CSS. It is limited in scope intentionally, but may be expanded upon later down the line.

The links on the page all work, but the ones in the header only link to YouTube videos intentionally.

All pictures belong to me. The picture used for the *The Lilly Project* emblem was generated using [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/home), and edited by me.
